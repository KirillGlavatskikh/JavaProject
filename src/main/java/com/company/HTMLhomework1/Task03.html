            The <b>HyperText Markup Language or HTML</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
            HTML elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms
            may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
            for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written
            using angle brackets. Tags such as directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as provide information about
            document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
            content of the page.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>HTML</u> can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web
            pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
            the <u>HTML</u> and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational <u>HTML</u>
            since 1997. A form of <u>HTML</u>, known as <u>HTML</u>, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration
            with javascript.

        <h3 align="center"> Markup </h3>
        <p>
            Markup language refers to a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure,
            formatting, or the relationship between its parts. Markup is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its
            content to facilitate automated processing. A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in
            a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs.
            The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is
            traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Older markup languages, which typically focus on typography and presentation, include troff, TeX and LaTeX. Scribe and most
            modern markup languages, for example XML, identify document components (for example headings, paragraphs, and tables), with
            the expectation that technology such as stylesheets will be used to apply formatting or other processing.
